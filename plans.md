# RockPaperScisors notes
## Bugs
- [x] fix the font sizes in the modal => shitty view in mobile.

## Plans
- [x] Game must stop and declare a winner after one side reaches 5 points; and then, score will be 0-0 and a new game will begin.

- [x] Must set the `user-select` property to `none` to avoid text highlighting and element selection.

- [x] Adding media queries for mobile.

- [x] Adding a footer for author github.

- [ ] Adding a Header.

## Experiments for feature branch

 - [x] Adding a modal for displaying the winner and the final score instead of an alert window.

 - [x] Add the emoji to the winner status in modal
