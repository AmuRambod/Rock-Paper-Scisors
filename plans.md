# RockPaperScisors notes
## Bugs
## Plans
- [x] Game must stop and declare a winner after one side reaches 5 points; and then, score will be 0-0 and a new game will begin.

- [x] Must set the `user-select` property to `none` to avoid text highlighting and element selection.

- [x] Adding media queries for mobile.

- [x] Adding a footer for author github.

- [ ] Adding a Header.

## Experiments for feature branch
- [x] converting `px` values to relative lengths.
